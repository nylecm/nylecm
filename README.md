## Hello

Hey, Iâ€™m Michal â€” a backend-leaning full-stack developer who builds clean, scalable systems and knows when to automate.

I care about solid architecture, developer experience, and writing code thatâ€™s easy to read and hard to break. I use AI tools where they actually help - not just for the sake of it.

**Languages:**  
TypeScript / JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, SQL

**DevOps & Cloud:**  
Docker, AWS (Lambda, S3, API Gateway, Step Functions etc.)

**Databases:**  
MariaDB/SQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB

**Tools:**  
Git, Drone CI/CD, Jira, AI tooling (i.e Copilot/GPT)
